Task 1 : Login & Registration System

Developed a fully functional login and registration system for an NGO volunteer portal named HopeBridge Foundation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to create an intuitive and visually appealing front-end form that allows users to sign up or log in with real-time input validation using regex patterns.
